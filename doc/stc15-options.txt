STC15 series MCS bytes
======================

MCS3 is like early STC15 MCS1.
MCS2 is like early STC15 MCS2.
MCS4 is like early STC15 MCS0 but with additions.
MCSX is like early STC15 MCS12.

baseline
B5 FF F7 BB 9F

long por disabled
B6 FF F7 BB 1F
--> MCS4 bit 7 controls POR delay. low => short, high => long

reset pin as io disabled
B8 FF F7 BB 8F
--> MCS4 bit 4 controls reset pin. low => reset is normal, high => reset is io

low voltage reset disabled
B6 FF F7 FB 9F
--> MCS3 bit 6 controls low voltage reset. low => lv reset enabled, high => disabled

lvd threshold 2.61v
B8 FF F7 BA 9F
lvd threshold 2.82v
B5 FF F7 B9 9F
lvd threshold 3.08v
B6 FF F7 B8 9F

--> MCS3 bits 0-2 control LVD threshold setting. exact mapping not yet clear.

eeprom lv inhibit disabled
B7 FF F7 3B 9F
--> MCS3 bit 7 controls eeprom lv inhibit. high => eeprom lv inhibit enabled, low => disabled

watchdog after reset enabled
B6 FF D7 BB 9F
--> MCS2 bit 5 controls watchdog after reset. high => disabled, low => enabled

watchdog prescaler 128
B4 FF F6 BB 9F
watchdog prescaler 64
B5 FF F5 BB 9F
watchdog prescaler 32
B5 FF F4 BB 9F
watchdog prescaler 2
B6 FF F0 BB 9F
--> MCS2 bits 0-2 control watchdog prescaler. mapping is similar to early STC15.

wdt stop in idle disabled
B7 FF FF BB 9F

erase eeprom next programming
B4 FF F7 BB 9F
--> it's somewhere else! it's bit 1 of the extra MCSX byte that is typically 0xfd. low => erase eeprom disabled, high => erase eeprom enabled


p3.3 por state enabled
B9 FF F7 BB 97
--> MCS4 bit 3 controls the p3.3 state. high => p3.3 high, low => p3.3 low

p3.1 passthrough from p3.0 enabled
B5 FF F7 BB DF
--> MCS4 bit 2 controls the p3.1 passthrough. low => passthrough disabled, high => passthrough enabled

p3.1 push pull enabled
B5 FF F7 BB BF
--> MCS4 bit 1 controls p3.1 push pull. low => quasi-bidi, high => push-pull

bsl pindetect enabled
B5 FF F7 BB BF
--> somewhere else, MCSX bit 0. low => pindetect enabled, high => pindetect disabled.


external oscillator enabled (IAP15F2K61S2)
9C 7F F7 BB 9E
--> MCS4 bit 0 controls external oscillator. low => use external crystal, high => use RC.

external oscillator enabled + clock gain low (IAP15F2K61S2)
9C 7F F7 BB 9C
--> MCS 4 bit controls clock gain. high => high clock gain, low => low clock gain.
