STC89

This is the first generation protocol of STC MCUs.

Differences to STC12:

* Uses NONE parity instead of EVEN parity.

* Checksum calculations are different: only a single-byte modular sum is used.

* Baudrate handshake isn't initiated with a type 0x50 packet; this is simply
  skipped.

* After the handshake a special ping-pong sequence of 0x80 type packets needs
  to be sent.
  This doesn't appear to serve any purpose - possibly this is just done to
  verify that the connection works reliably. STC12 doesn't require it anymore
  because parity and the improved checksum ensure correct operation.

* Erase is acknowledged with type 0x80 packet instead of type 0x00

* After flash programming, there is no finish packet, type 0x69, sent; this
  is simply skipped.

* Baudrate handshake
  - Uses normal speed (/32) UART timing instead of double speed (/16)
  - IAP delay has some differences (see datasheet)

* Erase procedure
  - A different magic sequence is used
    (6 bytes with value 0x33)
  - No size/range is supplied
  - response code has type 0x80
