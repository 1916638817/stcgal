Installation
============

stcgal requires Python 3.2 (or later) and pySerial. USB support is
optional and requires pyusb 1.0.0b2 or later. You can run stcgal
directly with the included ```stcgal.py``` script. The recommended
method for permanent installation is to use Python's setuptools. Run
```./setup.py build``` to build and ```sudo ./setup.py install```
to install stcgal. A permanent installation provides the ```stcgal```
command.
